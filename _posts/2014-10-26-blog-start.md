title: Blog Start
---

Today marks the first blog post for this site. I have decided to take another
crack at blogging in order to create one more task for me to find time for. I am
going to try to dedicate a post every two weeks at the least. I have found enough
reasons to motivate me to dedcicate my time to this blog.

## Self

Strengthening my writing skills is the first reason that came to mind. I spend
plenty of time at work writing code but I rarely sit down to write down a thought.
Writing articles on a frequent basis will give me an outlet to practice writing
and broadcasting it out to the world. I feel like sometimes a pool of thoughts
are just swirling in my brain. Spilling these thoughts into a site (or repo)
would be beneficial to myself.

## What kind of posts?

Technology articles would be a reoccurring post on this site. I have
been dedicating a lot of my time the last few months to learning rails and several
javascript frameworks to keep improving my tool belt. Writing up tutorials
based on my discovery would help reinforce the topic I just learned about. I
have also been starting to contribute to open source projects. I would like to have
write ups on the pull requests I made or any other knowledge gained from
contributing to open source. Putting the code to words to posts on the site
would help lockdown concepts and stacks in my memory.

Posts about books will be another topic that comes to mind. I have made a
priority to read constantly in the last year. Writing reviews (or more
creative posts) about one of the recent books I read would fall into this category.
Book posts would also help remembering what happens in the story I just read and
put my opinion of the subject matter down on paper.

## Site

Creating this repo will be the start of a personal site. A personal site that
will start off basic but, in time, can have a much better design. I can leave
small design ideas or quick proof of concepts to test out on the site.

I picked to build the site with Jekyll and use github as source control to
channel my inner hacker. I figure the easier it is to add a new post the more
likely I will just start writing and not worrying about an admin interface in
the way.

Now I have laid out the most important thoughts I had on creating this site. Site
is built. Hosted. First article done. More to come!
