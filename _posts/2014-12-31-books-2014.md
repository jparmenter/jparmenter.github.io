## Books 2014

Over the last year I set a goal to start reading more. I would like to discuss the results.

I read a total of 7,452 pages in 2014. Almost all of the books were fiction. Including 12 science fiction and 4 fantasy novels. I read four books of the Dune series and
 three H.G. Wells. I started a few series including *I, Robot* (Robot series), *Color of Magic*, and *The Hobbit*.

I picked out a few collection books so I read a few from the same author. I read three H.G. Wells, three Arthur Conan Doyle, and two Neil Gaiman books.

I enjoyed reading most of the books and excited to push my books read in 2015.
