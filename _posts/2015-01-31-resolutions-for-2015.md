title: Resolutions for 2015
---

This will be blog post number two that is under the wire for the month. I have
been a little preoccupied whether it be finishing the development cycle at work
or going to Ecuador for over ten days! I decided to stick with an ultra-classic
blog post by declare my resolutions for 2015.

The main goal for 2015 is to keep making myself as well-rounded adult as I can be.
I believe some things that will make a person a social, healthy, and knowledgeable
adult all stem from developing great habits and executing on them! Some ideas that
will keep me sharp are constant reading, socializing with friends, and learn new
things. Staying healthy is a goal I have strived for in the past but now I have
been focusing on it more than ever whether it is more exercise or having a balanced diet.

### Books!

My main goal last year was to read more books. I wrote up a
[short post last month](http://jparmenter.github.io/2014/12/31/books-2014.html)
listing out the success of my year. I am just going to try to top my books read of
twenty-eight. Maybe more than thirty? I honestly have done a very good job the last
few months of **always** picking up a new book once I am done with the current one.


Last year a majority of the books I read were fiction. I have taken note of that and
will try to diversify my palette when it comes to what books I choose. I have already
purchased a few non-fiction books and have been thinking about other genres to dip into.
I feel like I can learn a lot from the stories I read. My drive is to enjoy the stories
I am reading and not placing too much focus on trying to reach the end of the book to
continue my quest to explore the world of literature.

### Social

After reading *Paddle Your Own Canoe: One Manâ€™s Fundamentals for Delicious Living*
by Nick Offerman, I came to a realization that it is a very good idea to treat
others really well because that's what thoughtful, awesome people do.

One of the things I will continue to do is reach out to friends and socialize as much
as possible. I started last year to reconnect or stay connected to friends, and I
think it would be a great practice to build on. I will be making a promise to myself
to do my best to make it to any friend's event or party whether my mind wants to be
lazy at home or I think it's a *busy* day.

Something I picked up from Offerman that I will continue practicing throughout the
year is to create handmade cards for friends and family on days of importance. I have
already made a card for a few friends. They were just some drawings and stickers but it has
begun! I think I will even shoot for some photoshopped cards for a few lucky individuals.

### New Things

I have read two books last year suggesting to try new things. The first was *Paddle
Your Own Canoe* and *How to Talk to Anyone: 92 Little Tricks for Big Success in
Relationships* by Leil Lowndes. Both books promoted learning new things to broaden
your own life experiences and develop new hobbies.

After only the first month of the year, I have tried a lot of things I have never
done before. I went jet skiing and paragliding in Ecuador. I also went boogie
boarding at the beach in Punta Carnero, Ecuador. Even this past week I fixed my
toilet in my first ever plumbing experience. I have built up a list of things I
have never done and will try to accomplish one new thing every month.

### Exercise

I have always been an active person but I have been improving my exercise routine
recently. I regularly go to the climbing gym and usually get to the gym three times a
week. Typically at the climbing gym I warm up for about thirty minutes and then
red point for another hour and half at the least. It is a very good upper body
workout but I have been starting to work on my cardiovascular exercise as well.

I have begun using my legs more often. I have always hiked with my girlfriend, Jeanette,
whenever we could find the time. We would typically go hiking at Lookout Mountain or
the Gateway Loop trail. I have begun running around half the time on the hikes! I have
also tried to find time during a weekday to take a long walk. It is nice to step away
from the desk and get the heart going by take a twenty minute walk. I believe the more I
keep up on the cardio and climbing schedule will keep me in shape for anything.

### Diet

Diet! I have, like the other goals, begun executing on developing a healthier diet.
I have made steps to eat healthy snacks like nuts or fruits during the day. If I stay
in the office at work for lunch I usually make a salad and have some soup or bean burrito.
There was a point last week that I realized I had not eaten meat in a few days.
Quite the accomplishment for myself. I think signing up for Plated has helped as well.

Plated is a food delivery service that people can sign up for on a weekly or bi-weekly
basis. People are given a weekly menu to pick out meals and then the ingredients and
recipe are sent to the customer's door. I have been loving it and been making lots of new
dishes. My favorite recipes that I have repeated a few times are risotto with brussels
sprouts and fried tofu stir-fry with red pepper and mushrooms. I do not know how long
I will stay signed up for plated but I will stay subscribed until I feel equipped in
an arsenal of dishes.

There are seriously a lot of things I can do to better myself. I have not even thought
of stuff in other hobbies such as video games or tinkering with programming or other
technology stuff. These are the top five ideas to make me a better person. If I can
turn these goals into habits now, I can not imagine how useful or healthy I would be later
in life. Good luck with 2015 everyone. I know I will do my best.
