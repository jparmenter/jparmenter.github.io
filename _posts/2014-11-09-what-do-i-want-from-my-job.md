title: What do I want from my job?
---

After a very crazy week at my job I thought it would be a good time to put into
words what people should get out of a job. I work as a software engineer so the focus
will be on that but the entire idea could spread over most jobs and careers.
I have been working in a technical position for over four years and I have been
around an office enough to know what makes a great working environment. I have
spent a lot of time thinking what kind of qualities I would like to find in a job.

### Benefits and Stats

The most basic thing about a job would be what you get paid. Do you get paid what
someone in your position and experience should be paid? The average software engineer
salary in Phoenix, AZ is around [$78,000](http://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/phoenix-software-engineer-salary-SRCH_IL.0,7_IM678_KO8,25.htm).
That seems like a simple indicator to tell if your employer values your
skill sets. Other compensation that is beginning to become a requirement is stock
options. Shares in the company seems like a must especially if you were to join a
smaller company or a company going public. You should get a stake in driving the
product or company forward and be part of the success of giving the company a
greater value.

Ok. Write code and get paid well. What else is there? The employee essentials
should be covered such as medical, dental, 401K, and time-off. This stuff sounds
like a no brainer but purely stating the benefits just asserts how important these things
are needed from our employer, at least in America.

Work-life balance is something that should be important when it comes to finding a job.
We should have the ability to walk away from work and not worry about anything
blowing up while you are away. We should be able to take time-off to visit exotic
places or family without bringing a laptop with us. Ok, maybe you will
have a deployment late at night or a death march for a product launch to get to
customers. It should just not be an everyday or quarterly occurrence.

### The Work

Compared to other professions, programmers get a lot more diversity in their choice
of work. Do you want to work on the newest technologies? Do you want to work on
databases? Do you want to work on an enterprise system? Go for it! Seek out these
employers that match what kind of stack, technology, and product that you want to
work on.

The key piece here is that whatever you are working on be sure to love it because
you will be coming into the office to iterate on that everyday you are working with
the employer. Struggling to get up to go to work might not be a good indicator.
Procrastinating at the office would not be a good sign either. You need to be fired
up on coming to the office and jazzed to have the privilege to work with your product.

### The People

What you work on and the people you work with are probably tied as the most
important things with your job. You can be working on maintaining a legacy system while
working with great people and staying happy at your job for a long time.

What do you need out of the people you work with? The people you work with should cause
little to no friction. It should not feel like a chore working with or approaching
people to discuss problems. Sure, at certain points of working with a group of people
you might face problems and have a discussion on solving problems. There is a difference
between having an open discussion and having someone near you gossiping all day.

Now you have people that are sane human beings that do their job competently around you.
People working around you should have an open curiosity for the product they are working
on with you. Whether it is critiques in pull requests, user experience comments, or curiosity
on how you accomplished a task as long as the team around you are actively excited about
the work will make you more excited as well. Having a team exceptionally committed to what
they are doing will keep you wanting to come in and work together to get the job done.

An added bonus is when your team members will talk about new technology and discoveries they
find on their own. Could be a new technology article or some little proof of concept they
created it all will make you think that this guy is not satisfied by work alone. He
needs more code and information to feed his thirst for knowledge.

People, work, and benefits are pretty good legs in the tripod of work to make it really awesome.
Missing a piece could work for a time or a few years. After a while you may feel unsatisfied
and ready to find the job that fills all the needs to make you exceptionally happy at your job.
